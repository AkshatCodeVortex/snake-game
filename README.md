# snake-game

Creating a Snake game in JavaScript is a classic project for beginners. The game typically involves controlling a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, avoiding collisions with walls or itself.

To create this game, you'd typically:

Setting Up the Canvas: Use HTML to create a canvas element where the game will be displayed. JavaScript will interact with this canvas to draw the game elements.

Drawing the Snake: Define the snake as a series of connected segments. Use JavaScript to create the logic for the snake to move in response to user input (like arrow keys).

Generating Food: Randomly place food on the canvas for the snake to eat. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer.

Handling Collisions: Check for collisions between the snake and the canvas boundaries or itself. If the snake collides with the walls or itself, the game ends.

Game Loop: Create a game loop that updates the game state (snake movement, food generation, collision detection) and redraws the canvas to reflect these changes.
